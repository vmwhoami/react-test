### React App Collaboration Exercise Basic Search




#### The purpose of this exercise is to - 
- Create a single page application (SPA) using React where the user can filter through data using a search bar.
- Get a feel of working together with our team.
Not spend more than 2-3 hours to complete the task. If you are not able to complete it, that is totally fine. We are more interested in how you approached the problem and what you did, not necessarily the end result.
### Requirements
- The page should display a prominent search bar, and list of (filterable) results below it.
The user can type a value in the search bar. The dataset will be filtered in real-time based on the search.
- The URL should update on every search to contain the query, and should accept a query-string query on load if one is specified. This allows for a particular search query to be shared externally.
UI components should use Emotion’s styled components. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with this module — the UI does not have to be complex.
Guidelines
- For the purpose of this exercise, you can store the dataset locally in a variable. See the end of this document for an example.  Bonus -- if you store the data in some file store like Firebase and fetch via an API call.
- Feel free to use any state management library you’re normally using, or none at all by using on React’s own state hooks.
- If you have time left, think about any performance optimizations or simple tests. You don’t have to implement these, but a writeup of any ideas you come up with would be a nice bonus.
The exercise should take between two to three hours to complete.
